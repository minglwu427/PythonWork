1.  The NGS Analysis Data - This project is terminated.  The development of this code was kept internal.  
2.  PeptideRegisCode - This code is used to turn a commericial dataframe of raw peptide we rodered and convert it into a csv file for our automation robot.  The code to do this function is in Automated_peptide_Regis.py.  In addition, Table_To_Plate.py are codes that convert data reading in table format and convert to plate format.
